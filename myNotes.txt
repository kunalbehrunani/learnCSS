Types of CSS -
1. Inline Styling
2. Internal Style sheet
3. External Style sheet

Rule Set design - 

selector {
  key1: value1;       //properties
  key2: value2;
 }                    //declaration block


Selectors - 

1. Type selectors
2. universal selectors {*}
3. class selectors {.} 
4. id selectors {#}
5. Attribute selectors {[]}
6. pseudo-class selectors {:}
7. multiple selectors {,}

Specificity of selectors : type < class < id {order of overriding styles} Best practice - use least specificity. 

Chaining -> Classifying elements based on both type & class simultaneously. h1.className{} etc. h1: type, className: class type.

Chaining increases specificity. 

Descendant Combinators -> to target descendant/child elements of a given class. eg. Parent-selector chile-selector{} or .className descendantElementName {}

Descendant Combinators increases specificity.

Chaining Vs DC -> Chaining will consider both. Eg. h1.className{} => This would apply the styling to those elements which are h1 AND has class="className". While, DC would just apply styling to descendants/child elements. Ege. h1 p {} -> This would apply styling to only those p elements that are child to h1 elements. 




Lesson #2 - Visual Rules

font-family - Use Web Safe CSS Fonts. Compatible with most browsers. Others should be downloaded to use. may react differently on diff browsers.
font-size
font-weight
text-align - Alignment done with reference to parent html element
color - Foreground color
background-color
opacity - Range[0,1]
"!important" - eg. p{color:blue !important;} // override this style irrespective of specificity.


Lesson #3 - The Box Model

Every html element resides inside a box. 
Paramters of that box - content area (width & height), margins, border, padding.

Major keywords - width, height, padding, border, margin, overflow

Overflow => 3 values ie. visible, hidden, scroll {for spill over content w.r.t the parent box dimensions}

Content area - height & width;

border - syntax: border: size style color;
  default: medium none color {color of the element}
  size - in pixels, or keywords - thin, medium, thick
  style - solid, dotted, none etc.
  color - as usual.
border-radius: size;
if(height===width) && border-radius:50% => perfect circle outline

Padding -> space between the content & it's border.Mostly used to increase the background space for any content to be displayed inside a box.
padding: 10px; => Padding in all directions.
padding-top/right/bottom/left: 10px; => specific

Shorthand syntax for padding: 
  If(only 3 values) then right=left;
  If(only 2 values) then right=left && top=bottom.

Margin -> Place outside the box/border. To manage spacing/positioning with other external html elements. 
margin: 10px;
margin-top/right/bottom/left. Also shorthand works here to like padding. 
margin: 0px auto; => center the elements with respect to the outer box. 

imp: horizontal margins & paddings between two external html elements add up. For vertical => top & bottom margins will collapse, while, top & bottom paddings don't. 
Collapse => final-margin = max(marginA,marginB).

min-height/width & max-height/width

an HTML elements size = summation of size of all paramters ie. margins, paddings, content, border-thickness etc. And not just the content area.

overflow -> set on the parent's element to instruct browser on how to render child elements if size overexeceeds it's parent's dimensions.

visibility -> hidden, visible, collapse. If hidden, the void/structure/space of that html element would still persist but content would be hidden. 
However, If {display:none;} then whole element is removed.

Resetting Defaults - Sometimes, browser have default paddings/margins. This can confuse the developer, hence make everything to default - 
//code
*{
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;
 }
