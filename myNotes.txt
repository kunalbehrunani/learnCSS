Types of CSS -
1. Inline Styling
2. Internal Style sheet
3. External Style sheet

Rule Set design - 

selector {
  key1: value1;       //properties
  key2: value2;
 }                    //declaration block


Selectors - 

1. Type selectors
2. universal selectors
3. class selectors 
4. id selectors
5. Attribute selectors
6. pseudo-class selectors
7. multiple selectors

Specificity of selectors : type < class < id {order of overriding styles} Best practice - use least specificity. 

Chaining -> Classifying elements based on both type & class simultaneously. h1.className{} etc. h1: type, className: class type.

Chaining increases specificity. 

Descendant Combinators -> to target descendant/child elements of a given class. eg. Parent-selector chile-selector{} or .className descendantElementName {}

Descendant Combinators increases specificity.

Chaining Vs DC -> Chaining will consider both. Eg. h1.className{} => This would apply the styling to those elements which are h1 AND has class="className". While, DC would just apply styling to descendants/child elements. Ege. h1 p {} -> This would apply styling to only those p elements that are child to h1 elements.
